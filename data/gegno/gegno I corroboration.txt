It's likely this world is also home to the same or similar species of large, worm-like creatures you confronted back then. Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior experience, the ship isn't sunken into the desert, likely having recently landed here. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, your radar picks up two more ships descending from above.`

One of them is the same type of model as the one on the ground, likely some type of transport. The other, however, isn't one you've seen before. It looks like some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter. Perhaps that ship belongs to someone of importance.`

While the other transport vessel has touched down already, the interceptor is still in the process of landing, but suddenly whips around to face you as you approach. Unlike the initial reaction of the Scin's warships you confronted a few days ago, the Vi are quick to respond to your presence, and in contrast to a few minutes ago, are clearly acknowledging it. A moment later, you receive what sounds like an angry hail from the interceptor.`

Once you back off, the interceptor briefly jerks forward at you in a vexed manner, continuing to observe you until you've left the area. While the Scin seemed more open to interaction, the Vi are clearly adversive to it.`

If you recall, we have attempted prior consel with the Gegno, yet bound they are in their ways, even should it mean incredulously opposing us Quarg."`

Many times I have said this, that the Gegno are not what I would consider humans to posses knowledge of. Should you learn more, I'm afraid even then the Gegno do not contrastingly desire, what was the human word - camaraderie?" The Gegno then asks something in their language, and Adrauni begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`

			`	You walk in silence for an awkward period of time. The strange architecture of the ringworld does little to comfort you, as it feels like you've walked down the same path several times now. A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. Before you begin asking more questions, Adrauni finally replies. "It is apparent that you may understand something of your fragile circumstance. It is no longer what I, rather, the Quarg, can do for you. It is what you can do for yourself."`

A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. "Yes, it may be that your timely departure is the most favorable outcome in this affair." A long, awkward silence ensues, at the end of which Adrauni briefly comes to a hault, still facing forward, now crossing its armos behind its back. "Though you and I figure that is - unlikely."`
				goto "visit a"

			label "visit a"
			`	A few more pathways later, you are at the end of your seemingly long trip through the ringworld, finding yourself back where you started - the docking facility where your ship is stationed at. Although it felt like a dizzying maze to follow Adrauni around back to here, you can't help but imagine how much more confusing it would be to explore the entirety of a ringworld, considering that was only several minutes worth. Adrauni stops and turns to you, slightly lowering down to speak closer to your own height. "You must seek audience on your own, tenacious, behalf. Visit the Gegno homeworld of Dueyu Eitch, present yourself in a manner that you desire to be perceived. Only then will you find your desired answer."`

"Habitually, we Quarg scarcely visit the Gegno for the most minor of reasons. Should you be accompanied at this time, the Gegno's unstable perception of you would alter further. Imagine if the Quarg visited your own planet called Earth with strange others in tow." You guess that Adrauni then does what the Quarg equivalent of a sigh would be.

You get the feeling that this might have been the last time you meet with it. As you return to your ship, a few other Quarg, who have been watching the conversation from afar, also return to their normal routine as if nothing had happened. Now, it is up to you to see for yourself whether or not the Gegno will accept you.`

			`Once you land on the ringworld, you notice a group of Gegno off to the side of the hangar you are stationed in. They appear to be warriors of the Vi based on their appearance, and while they aren't moving from their position, they watch you intently as you exit your ship. A small group of Quarg then approach you and quickly motion you to follow them, escorting you through various halls of the ring. Eventually you are led to the room where you met Adrauni in the past, or perhaps one identical to it. "Please, seat yourself with I."`
			`	You sit down, along with two other Quarg, and the rest of them leave the room with the door sliding shut behind them. Adrauni stares blankly at you for a while, then speaks. "I presume you understand what result came from my negotiations with the tedious Gegno."`

Although we Quarg are, by your definition, minimally tolerative of your species, access to only some of our wondrous worlds we give you. However, what of humans to others? Should the Gegno, or species of other eccentricities, be given leisure to your planet Earth? May it be the case with you, though with anxious humanity, it certainly would not be." One of the other Quarg in the room says something to Adrauni, to which it begins a conversation in its own language.`

					goto "work"
				`	"I guess I should leave them alone."`
					goto "alone"

			label "tech"
			`	Adrauni clicks its teeth together in what appears to be a laughing manner, a reaction you have yet to see from it. "And we many Quarg, of those who live among ambitious humans, allowance of our tech have we given? One is not owed rights to another's under pretensive tolerance." The other Quarg in the room look at Adrauni strangely, to which it begins a conversation with them in their own language. After a few moments, they too stare at you with strange looks, followed by an awkward silence, which is broken by Adrauni speaking to you once more. "With us as well, hardly do the Gegno share much intrigue at all."`

					goto "alone"

			label "dont know"
			`	"Indeed, you do not. To tolerate is to authorize unrestricted occurrence despite undesired preface. In this lies not the Gegno's interest, as once I have said before." It looks up in thought for several moments. "Perhaps in your naive judgment I am mistaken. Humans tolerate their own undesirables, those who have come to be known as corsairs. Portions of your species permit their tiresome actions, while others do not. Be that as it may, suppose a species other than humanity begins similar agitation. I would presume the case to be different." Adrauni then begins a conversation with the other Quarg in the room.`

A show of force is most unprecedented, even more so opposed to other means of less inmodest communication. I had the slightest hope you understood my preachings of nonviolence, as I believe there to be benefit from optimistic aspirations in younger species, but ultimately my hopes are proven unfounded." Some of the other Quarg in the room abruptly address Adrauni as if you weren't present and begin a long period of debate, occasionally followed by glares in your direction.`

It is quite a dangerous practice to commit and act before knowledge, as we Quarg have been advising you impulsive humans for many years. In our discussions with you, evident it is that this has proven to be true. However, the great bounds stepped beyond here go beyond what we are able to accommodate." Adrauni then changes its expression slightly, glaring at you again. "Particularly after continual warnings prior." One of the other Quarg in the room says something to Adrauni, to which it begins a conversation in its own language.`

The strange structure and bright lights of the room do little to comfort you as the Quarg ponder to themselves. A few moments later, they begin talking amongst themselves once more, but you don't get a chance to get a word in. After several more minutes of deliberation and strange looks, the other Quarg stand up and flank you from both sides, while Adrauni finally addresses you once more. "Unfortunately, at this stage of events, I, nor the Quarg, can no longer give you an answer to your inquiry. We are of agreement in strong opposition to further interaction between yourself and the Gegno." It then does what you think would be the eqiuvalent of a Quarg sigh.`

You can't help but remember that this is only one small section of the ring, making the rest of it seem even more impossibly large and filled with Quarg. Once you return to the hangar, you're greeted by the sight of the Vi Warriors being blocked off by a larger group of Quarg, although there doesn't seem to be any intentions of hostility, nor conversation, from either side. Adrauni then stops in front of you. "It is no longer in our jurisdiction to assist you in this. However, if you indeed continue to pursue this desire to associate with the Gegno, you must seek audience yourself.

Near them, a small group of Quarg seem to be "conversing" with a smaller group of Gegno that seem rather upset. As soon as you exit your ship, both groups stop and look your way as you recognize Adrauni swiftly approaching you alongside a Gegno that is wearing a very fancy set of armor, neither Scin nor Vi in appearance.`

Meddled in their affairs you have, one too many times. As much of a desire I have to converse with you more on the matter, I, nor the Quarg, are no longer of help to you in your endeavours here." Adrauni turns to the Gegno, who seems almost dismissive, or at the very least trying to avoid eye contact with you. After a brief discussion of which nothing you understood, the Gegno walks off to the tan-colored ship, followed by all of the other Gegno in the hangar also returning to their own ships.`
