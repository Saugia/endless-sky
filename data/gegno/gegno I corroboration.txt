It's likely this world is also home to the same or similar species of large, worm-like creatures you confronted back then. Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior experience, the ship isn't sunken into the desert, likely having recently landed here. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, your radar picks up two more ships descending from above.`

One of them is the same type of model as the one on the ground, likely some type of transport. The other, however, isn't one you've seen before. It looks like some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter. Perhaps that ship belongs to someone of importance.`

While the other transport vessel has touched down already, the interceptor is still in the process of landing, but suddenly whips around to face you as you approach. Unlike the initial reaction of the Scin's warships you confronted a few days ago, the Vi are quick to respond to your presence, and in contrast to a few minutes ago, are clearly acknowledging it. A moment later, you receive what sounds like an angry hail from the interceptor.`

While the Scin seemed more open to interaction, the Vi are clearly adversive to it.`

If it weren't as such, I may not be the one speaking with you in this moment. Or, perhaps, it would be no one." It then looks forward again as you continue on your stroll, leaving you to think on those words. "Unfortunately, the Quarg are unable to further assist you in this delicate matter.

Many times I have said this, that the Gegno are not what I would consider humans to posses knowledge of. Should you learn more, I'm afraid even then the Gegno do not contrastingly desire, what was the human word - camaraderie?"

A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. Before you begin asking more questions, Adrauni finally replies. "It is apparent that you may understand something of your fragile circumstance. It is no longer what I, rather, the Quarg, can do for you. It is what you can do for yourself."`

Adrauni stops and turns to you, slightly lowering down to speak closer to your own height. "You must seek audience on your own, tenacious, behalf. Visit the Gegno homeworld of Dueyu Eitch, present yourself in a manner that you desire to be perceived. Only then will you find your desired answer."`

A small group of Quarg then approach you and quickly motion you to follow them, escorting you through various halls of the ring. Eventually you are led to the room where you met Adrauni in the past, or perhaps one identical to it. "Please, seat yourself with I."`

Should the Gegno, or species of other eccentricities, be given leisure to your planet Earth? May it be the case with you, though with anxious humanity, it certainly would not be."

The other Quarg in the room look at Adrauni strangely, to which it begins a conversation with them in their own language.

It looks up in thought for several moments. "Perhaps in your naive judgment I am mistaken. Humans tolerate their own undesirables, those who have come to be known as corsairs. Portions of your species permit their tiresome actions, while others do not. Be that as it may, suppose a species other than humanity begins similar agitation.

Adrauni then changes its expression slightly, glaring at you again. "Particularly after continual warnings prior."

"Unfortunately, at this stage of events, I, nor the Quarg, can no longer give you an answer to your inquiry.

Once you return to the hangar, you're greeted by the sight of the Vi Warriors being blocked off by a larger group of Quarg, although there doesn't seem to be any intentions of hostility, nor conversation, from either side. Adrauni then stops in front of you. "It is no longer in our jurisdiction to assist you in this.

You were expecting at least something similar to the interior of human buildings, but the first area you enter in looks like it almost came straight out of some old medieval fantasy story. Everything is very rocky in appearance, although it seems more intentional than natural, as if it was sculpted this way. Some entrances seem to be made of newer metallic materials, while others seem as old as the foundation itself. You wonder if all Gegno architecture is built like this, but your curiosity is cut short when the Gegno, that has been many steps ahead of you, grunts and gestures you down a different path. Eventually you are lead into an enormous open room, probably half the diameter of the building itself. It may not be anything comparable to a Quarg station, but you have to wonder how nobody gets lost here.`

You reluctantly enter the other one, and after a few moments, begin ascending as well. The shaking and clanging of the lift doesn't exactly ease your mind, but at least you're still in one piece.`
			`	All of a sudden, you start to hear a deep, methodical rumble coming from above you. A few more seconds go by, and in an instant you're met with a gust of air. Your cage is out in the open air, connected to just a few support beams and the pulley system that is lifting it. Surrounding the core of the tower in front of you are other large metal pulley systems, with the Gegno in the one in the distance to your left. The low rumbling you heard earlier is clear now - as you're ascending, various levels of the tower's core have numerous balconies with many other Gegno playing large timpany-like drums to a tribal-like tune, occasionally grunting or blowing another horn-like instrument.`
			`	After a few more minutes of chanting and drumming, several layers of smog, and possibly height sickness, the lift arrives at the very top of the tower - a huge, circular platform out in the open with a bunch of important-looking Gegno formed up around a large device of sorts. In contrast to the base, this part of the tower seems to be the most technologically advanced, with some other devices spead around the surface. Extending to the darkened sky is a ring of electronic torches, and as you look at them, you see in the far distance other towers and buildings alike. The Gegno that has guided you here gestures one last time to go to their location amongst the others.`

				`	(Go to the Gegno.)`
					goto "meeting"
				`	(Stay where you are.)`

			`	It's not long before a pair of Gegno soldiers walk over and essentially "pressure" you into joining the others. You're on their turf now, so you might as well play by their rules.`

			label meeting
			`	Once you meet up with the Gegno, the drumming and chants come to an abrupt hault. The device at the center of the platform is some sort of monitor on the ground, and shown on it are various texts - none of which you can understand. Three Gegno standing next to one another, separate from everyone else, begin speaking in low, booming voices, also none of which you can understand. One of them is very bulky and looks like Gegno that belong to the Vi faction, meanwhile the other two are a bit more like the civilian Gegno you've seen glimpses of before. All three of them are wearing the same set of armor, which looks much more intricate than anything else you've seen, with various protrustions, drapes, and other details. Aside from them, all of the other Gegno present are of various builds, though none of them are wearing any colors indicating a faction. Some of them gaze toward you occasionally, while others pay you no attention at all.`
			`	The awkwardness of the situation increases as time goes by. Several minutes have passed now, and during that time, a few Gegno from the crowd have stepped up to the opposite side of the device from the trio, possibly speaking about you as they do. You look over to your Gegno guide standing next to you, but their gaze is locked on the conversation ahead. They haven't gone up to speak at all, until a few moments later, when one of the trio calls them over. An image of the desert planet where everything started comes up on the device, and a heated-sounding discussion follows. As you watch, you notice that it is the only Gegno with that red band on their arm. The other Gegno in the crowd don't seem very pleased as their discussion continues.`
			`	Though it seemed like it was never coming, the moment comes where the bulkier of the trio directly gestures to you. The tension of the situation skyrockets as they say something in their language, then gesture you to stand across from them. All of the other Gegno are now staring you down, waiting, as your guide heads off to the side.`
			choice
				`	(Approach the trio.)`
				`	(Remain where you stand.)`
#					goto "stay"

			`	Any Gegno in your path march out of your way as you approach the center of the platform. You're in the spotlight now, and the silence is deafening. As soon as you stop at the trio, a few images of the <ship> in various contexts come up on the device, alongside images of several planets you've been to in Gegno space. Following another brief moment of silence, one which seemingly everyone braces themselves for, one of the three addresses you in their language at a lower volume than they were speaking before.`
			`	"Eyuu udyom Gegno tyysis. Udiyh tei arrtes ofor tei piyepuo?"`
			choice
				`	"Are you asking something about the Gegno?"`
				`	"I would like to work out something with the Gegno."`
				`	"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you are saying."`

			`	The Gegno stares at you, then looks at the display.`

			label "no more gegno"
			`	You ultimately decide that pursing this ruse with the Gegno is no longer worth the effort. Even if you did meet up with them, or ended up in some sort of debate with them, it would likely take another excessive amount of effort in order to get any amount of progression with them, if at all. Perhaps even landing here was a mistake, as you could never guess what might happen if you continued this endeavor, given you are all alone on the homeworld of a species that has shown to be rather xenophobic, even to the Quarg.`
			`	As you prepare to depart, the Gegno, who was watching you all this time with a blank stare, lifts their staff weapon and flips it around. Following an explosive cloud of smoke, a sizable crater appears just barely next to your ship on the ground. It seems they are, at the very least, unhappy with your decision to leave, which is a little odd considering they didn't want anything to do with you before. Though, the fact they intentionally missed such a large target might have other connotations. Regardless, it could have been you on the other end of that blast.`
