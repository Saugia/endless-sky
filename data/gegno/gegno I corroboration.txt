			`While navigating the skies of this desert world, you notice familiar readings to the planet you previously encountered a member of the Gegno Vi on. It's likely this world is also home to the same or similar species of large, worm-like creatures you confronted back then. Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior experience, the ship isn't sunken into the desert, likely having recently landed here. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, your radar picks up two more ships descending from above.`
			choice
				`	(Leave.)`
					goto leave
				`	(Continue to observe.)`
			`	The approaching ships continue their descent, paying you no attention. They appear to be ones that were in orbit when you first entered the system. One of them is the same type of model as the one on the ground, likely some type of transport. The other, however, isn't one you've seen before. It looks like some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter. Perhaps that ship belongs to someone of importance.`
			`	In any case, considering that the planet is home to more of those monsters from before, and the Vi are here in numbers, it might be best you take your leave now before the situation gets out of control again.`
			choice
				`	(Leave.)`
					goto leave
				`	(Approach the landing zone.)`
			`	Throttling your ship forward, you head towards the Vi's landing zone. While the other transport vessel has touched down already, the interceptor is still in the process of landing, but suddenly whips around to face you as you approach. Unlike the initial reaction of the Scin's warships you confronted a few days ago, the Vi are quick to respond to your presence, and in contrast to a few minutes ago, are clearly acknowledging it. A moment later, you receive what sounds like an angry hail from the interceptor.`
			`	"Tchii ciei escitch tchii iedf teih Voordhte!"`
			choice
				`	(Leave now.)`
				`	(Continue.)`
					goto continue
			`	You decide it's best to not enroach on the Vi's area any more, as there's no telling what they'd do if you continued to do so. Once you back off, the interceptor briefly jerks forward at you in a vexed manner, continuing to observe you until you've left the area. While the Scin seemed more open to interaction, the Vi are clearly adversive to it.`

Even some of the Vi solders on the ground are shouting and gesturing towards your vessel with their weapons. It would seem the Vi are no longer tolerative of your presence.`

Still, since this planet isn't strictly owned by the Gegno, it makes for a convenient place to stop, and they haven't seemed to either notice nor care when you have landed here before.`

			`After you go through your post-docking routine and enter the ringworld, you can't help but feel that something is a bit off. Normally the Quarg here would be swiftly walking about, focused on attending to their duties, but for some reason, there seems to be less of them around than usual. Moreover, those you do come across are occasionally having discussions with one another, sometimes looking in your direction even for the slightest second. What stands out the most is the lack of any Gegno in the area you're in at all.`

We Quarg woefully witnessed that hazardous conflict - it was a time of great waste, unfortunate peril, and unsavory distrust among humanity. The Gegno are in a vulnerable state notably comparable to such a time. Reluctantly, the truth remains that we have been contacted by numerous members of high Gegno standing in respect to your continued interference. We wish for it to be matter only for further strict cautionaries, but regrettably, the Gegno believe it a matter beyond intricate attentiveness." The Quarg leaves its chair and motions you to do the same.`
			`	"Our best of recommendations to you is in departure from Gegno space as of this decisive moment. Meanwhile, we shall attempt a most careful negotiation with their hierarchy to come in terms of an acceptable toleration of storts. Should we find commonality, you will receive communication from one of the title "Adrauni", as has been bestowed upon me."`
			`	The rest of the Quarg, who have been listening to the conversation attentively the whole time, begin to escort you out of the room. If the Gegno are willing to go as far as to contact the Quarg about your appearances, then this is truly an important matter to them. For the time being, it's probably best to listen to the Quarg's warnings this time around and leave Gegno space until some kind of resolution is found, if at all.`
