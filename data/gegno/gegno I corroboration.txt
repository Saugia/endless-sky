It's likely this world is also home to the same or similar species of large, worm-like creatures you confronted back then. Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior experience, the ship isn't sunken into the desert, likely having recently landed here. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, your radar picks up two more ships descending from above.`

One of them is the same type of model as the one on the ground, likely some type of transport. The other, however, isn't one you've seen before. It looks like some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter. Perhaps that ship belongs to someone of importance.`

While the other transport vessel has touched down already, the interceptor is still in the process of landing, but suddenly whips around to face you as you approach. Unlike the initial reaction of the Scin's warships you confronted a few days ago, the Vi are quick to respond to your presence, and in contrast to a few minutes ago, are clearly acknowledging it. A moment later, you receive what sounds like an angry hail from the interceptor.`

Once you back off, the interceptor briefly jerks forward at you in a vexed manner, continuing to observe you until you've left the area. While the Scin seemed more open to interaction, the Vi are clearly adversive to it.`

Normally the Quarg here would be swiftly walking about, focused on attending to their duties, but for some reason, there seems to be less of them around than usual. Moreover, those you do come across are occasionally having discussions with one another, sometimes looking in your direction even for the slightest second. What stands out the most is the lack of any Gegno in the area you're in at all.`
			`	A few minutes later, while you are making your way through the pristine interior of the ring, you hear a voice call to you from down one of the various branching corridors. Turning around, you recognize the unique attire of the Quarg that has helped you in the past, along with a few others.`

			`	After a pause, Adrauni turns toward you, stares at you briefly, then looks back forward as the three of you continue through the ring. "Quite an important conclusion, is that not? Many times I have said this, that the Gegno are not what I would consider humans to posses knowledge of. Should you learn more, I'm afraid even then the Gegno do not contrastingly desire, what was the human word - camaraderie?" The Gegno then asks something in their language, and Adrauni begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`

			`	The Quarg turns back to you. "You are here not at the whim of your fanatic species, but at your own behest. Actions you take may be that of a human, but are not willed by that of humanity." Blinking slowly, Adrauni then turns to the Gegno and begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`
				goto "visit a"

			label "understand"
			`	You walk in silence for an awkward period of time. The strange architecture of the ringworld does little to comfort you, as it feels like you've walked down the same path several times now. A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. Before you begin asking more questions, Adrauni finally replies. "It is apparent that you may understand something of your fragile circumstance. It is no longer what I, rather, the Quarg, can do for you. It is what you can do for yourself."`

A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. "Yes, it may be that your timely departure is the most favorable outcome in this affair." A long, awkward silence ensues, at the end of which Adrauni briefly comes to a hault, still facing forward, now crossing its armos behind its back. "Though you and I figure that is - unlikely."`
				goto "visit a"

			label "visit a"
			`	A few more pathways later, you are at the end of your seemingly long trip through the ringworld, finding yourself back where you started - the docking facility where your ship is stationed at. Although it felt like a dizzying maze to follow Adrauni around back to here, you can't help but imagine how much more confusing it would be to explore the entirety of a ringworld, considering that was only several minutes worth. Adrauni stops and turns to you, slightly lowering down to speak closer to your own height. "You must seek audience on your own, tenacious, behalf. Visit the Gegno homeworld of Dueyu Eitch, present yourself in a manner that you desire to be perceived. Only then will you find your desired answer."`

That of the female Scin is tradition to allocate time of research just short of a lifespan. Whom you speak of is very much devoted to us here, nothing more. For any official matters with the Gegno to pass, they must go through the great heart of the colony."`

"Habitually, we Quarg scarcely visit the Gegno for the most minor of reasons. Should you be accompanied at this time, the Gegno's unstable perception of you would alter further. Imagine if the Quarg visited your own planet called Earth with strange others in tow." You guess that Adrauni then does what the Quarg equivalent of a sigh would be. "However yes, I am capabale of sending you escort. Be certain in this decision."`

You get the feeling that this might have been the last time you meet with it. As you return to your ship, a few other Quarg, who have been watching the conversation from afar, also return to their normal routine as if nothing had happened. Now, it is up to you to see for yourself whether or not the Gegno will accept you.`

# Negative Rep

			label "negative rep"

			`Once you land on the ringworld, you notice a group of Gegno off to the side of the hangar you are stationed in. They appear to be warrors of the Vi based on their appearance, and while they aren't moving from their position, they watch you intently as you exit your ship. A small group of Quarg then approach you and quickly motion you to follow them, escorting you through various halls of the ring. Eventually you are led to the room where you met Adrauni in the past, or perhaps one identical to it. "Please, seat yourself with I."`
			`	You sit down, along with two other Quarg, and the rest of them leave the room with the door sliding shut behind them. Adrauni stares blankly at you for a while, then speaks. "I presume you understand what result came from my negotiations with the tedious Gegno."`
			choice
				`	"That they will tolerate me?"`
				`	"That they are upset with me?"`
					goto "upset"
				`	"No, I do not."`

			choice
				`	"Permission to land on their worlds."`
				`	"Allow me access to their technology."`
					goto "tech"
				`	"I don't know."`
					goto "dont know"

			`	Adrauni ponders for a few moments. "That is a rather human response. Although we Quarg are, by your definition, minimally tolerative of your species, access to only some of our wondrous worlds we give you. However, what of humans to others? Should the Gegno, or species of other eccentricities, be given leisure to your planet Earth? May it be the case with you, though with anxious humanity, it certainly would not be." One of the other Quarg in the room says something to Adrauni, to which it begins a conversation in its own language."`
			choice
				`	"Is there no way I can work with the Gegno?"`
					goto "work"
				`	"I guess I should leave them alone."`
					goto "alone"

			label "tech"
			`	Adrauni clicks its teeth together in what appears to be a laughing manner, a reaction you have yet to see from it. "And we many Quarg, of those who live among ambitious humans, allowance of our tech have we given? One is not owed rights to another's under pretensive tolernace." The other Quarg in the room look at Adrauni strangely, to which it begins a conversation with them in their own language. After a few moments, they too stare at you with strange looks, followed by an awkward silence, which is broken by Adrauni speaking to you once more. "With us as well, hardly do the Gegno share much intrigue at all."`
			choice
				`	"Then is there no way I can work with the Gegno?"`
					goto "work"
				`	"I guess I should leave them alone."`
					goto "alone"

			label "dont know"
			`	"Indeed, you do not. To tolerate is to authorize unrestricted occurrence despite undesired preface. In this lies not the Gegno's interest, as once I have said before." It looks up in thought for several moments. "Perhaps in your naive judgment I am mistaken. Humans tolerate their own undesirables, those who have come to be known as corsairs. Portions of your species permit their tiresome actions, while others do not. Be that as it may, suppose a species other than humanity begins similar agitation. I would presume the case to be different." Adrauni then begins a conversation with the other Quarg in the room."`
