Unlike others around the hangar, they're wearing a dark-brown vest of sorts, adorned with various small badges.`
			`	Finally, they gesture you to follow them, leading you to a smaller area, albeit still only partially constructed like the rest of the station. In it are some other Gegno going to and from another wall-mounted display that also lists various jobs. Thankfully, these share the same visuals as the others, showing more minable asteroids with tally-marks, though these jobs seem to request more than the others, and pay more as well.`
			`	You turn around to address at the Gegno that led you here once more, but they already have vanished to somewhere else in the station. Although the Gegno continue to treat you dismissively, it appears you've now been given access to more demanding and rewarding jobs. Perhaps they are beginning to place some value in you after all.`

Although in some places the Gegno have built up on the interior, other places have begun to fall victim to a lack of maintenance, effectively making any progression on the station's construction net-neutral. Despite the size of the station, the recent decline in activity only continues the trend. There's not much you have to say in it, as your interactions remain limited to working with the Gegno dockworkers that haul the various mined minerals you've been gathering for them.`

Faint sounds of deeply-pitched buzzers begin eminating from the halls, and most Gegno slowly begin marching down towards the source of the commotion.`

In the middle of the area are three Gegno in various attire standing around one of the station's support beams, leading others down the various corridors with the aid of tablet devices. Two of the Gegno are around the average civilian build, with one of them in gear similar to those you've seen cargo haulers wear, and the other in a much heavier gear set with various tools attached to it, like those who work on infrastructural maintenance.

Looking down to their tablet, they drag their large fingers around a few times, scrolling through various pages of information. Another Gegno comes up behind you in a lighter gear set, and the maintenance lead speaks to them briefly. Another awkward pause ensues, with the other Gegno looking at you, and then back at the lead, who instructs them to quickly escort you back down the corridor you came from.`
			`	As you're escorted back down the halls, a few more Gegno along the way give you passing glares, and on occasion, the one escorting you grunts at them, though you're not sure in what manner.

They turn the display to you, and on it shows a sort of blueprint of the station interior, with some of the blocks being hatched off. From what you can gather, those are the sections that don't have a working atmosphere, which require you to wear your environmental suit.

You're then escorted to the entrance of another docking bay, with red lights glowing all around. Waiting by it is a small group of Gegno, all wearing the same heavy equipment as the lead, who is also present. Some of them are equipped with strange, large tools, and a few others are surrounding a large crate of various other tools. It is eerily silent once the three of you arrive, several of them gazing in your direction.`

With a few clanks and harsh metal sounds, the warning lights and buzzers go out, and the door opens, revealing the docking bay - or at least, where one is supposed to be. Instead, is a gaping hole into space, with tons of debris floating about. Drifting slowly away from the station in the distance is a large Gegno mining ship, with the front section dented and banged up.`

Some of them walk around, manually moving debris around, and others use their large tools to take apart certain devices.

It's not your place to tell them they're being wasteful, though, or rather, you probably couldn't.`

			`Similar to the Gegno's homeworld, this planet features vast expanses of barren land, deserts, and mountainous landscapes. At first, it feels oddly devoid of civilization, but as you descend towards the surface, you notice a few enormous, web-like roads stretching far from one side of the horizon to another, connecting to various structures in the distance. The Gegno escorting you slowly appears in their shuttle from above and flies ahead, taking you into the great desert lands.`
			`	Closer to the surface, you can more clearly see that the roads are decently high off of the ground, almost as if they were bridges above the seas of sand, connecting occasional structures along the way. Eventually they lead to what is likely your destination - four spire-like towers extending high into the dusty skies, arranged in a sort of trapezoidal pattern, with a fifth one half-constructed on the side. Although they aren't as bulky as the one you visited on the Gegno homeworld, they are much taller, and have many more support beams jutting out from them into the ground below.`
			`	As you arrive to the site, you are escorted to a landing bay on the side of one of the completed towers. While parking next to the shuttle, you see several Gegno walking over, some more hesitant than others.`

			`The Gegno abruptly leave your ship as soon as you dock with much more energy than you've seen most others on the station have. As they head off down the various corridors, another briskly approaches you. They're one of those with a slimmer build, and seem to be wearing some sort of fancy outfit, rather than heavy hauling gear. They hold up some sort of computational device, and you soon find that a sum of <payment> has been added to your account. They glance at you afterwards, though the look they give you seems much less that of indifference, or at least, it's a look you have yet to see the Gegno give you.`
			`	As they walk off, you look around to see that there are much less Gegno loafing about. The station's activity has picked up a bit more with a larger volume of ships docking and leaving, also bringing other Gegno to help assist in repair efforts, with some larger vessels bring in big cargo hauls of supplies. Unfortunately, any desire of yours to try and go to the more busy areas is declined, but there's more work being put into it than when the incident had first occured.`

			`This world is a vast desert expanse, a majority of the surface covered in a deep layer of sands and sediments. Aside from distant mountainous rock formations, it almost appears as there is a lack of any civilization, but you start to notice long, spindling roads crossing from one horizon to another. The blocky Gegno ship, owned by the hauling lead that personally escorted you here, slowly appears from above and moves to escort you ahead.`
			`	You are taken down to the level of the roads, which are much more massive than they first appeared from above. They're something like giant bridges, towering above the seas of sand. Occasionally inbetween the roads are small towers, likely checkpoints of sorts for those traveling the great plains. Up ahead, a small city on the floor of the desert comes into view, likely being your destination. However, as the Gegno leads you closer to it, you realize it's not something as simple as that. The whole structure is actually an enormous land-crawler, currently resting on its six gigantic treads.`
			`	The crawler might as well be a city as it even has its own landing ports, one of which you touch down on. Other Gegno ships of various sizes are parked nearby, loading up on many heavy-looking cargo crates and materials. A group of workers then slowly roll several crates of supplies towards your own ship.`

Once both of your ships are full, the Gegno stand back and await your departure, huddling back together and watching with their many looks.

			`A team of Gegno are already awaiting your arrival as you dock, quickly unloading the supplies. Other Gegno see to it that the supplies are routed down the various corridors to get to repairs almost immediately, which is a dedication you haven't previously experienced here on the station. A moment later, you see the hauling lead heading in your direction. They pull out their familiar tablet device, and after some fiddling with it, you soon find a sum of <payment> has been attributed to your account.`
			`	Rather than directly head over to help the others, they give you a lighter punch on the back, and after a quick glance, begin their way down the halls. Unfortunately, any desire of yours to follow them or go to the more busy areas is denied, but it's clear there's more work being done for the station than before.`
