			`Aside from the occasional unloading of mined minerals from your cargo hold, the Gegno at this station have continued to ignore your presence one way or another, whether it's actively or passively. However, today seems to be different as you are approached directly by one of Gegno, who is carrying a tablet device larger than ones you've seen others handle before.`
			`	Standing before you, they hold their device to their chest as they begin tapping and dragging on it with their free hand. Their appearance is more similar to members of the Scin you've interacted with before; somewhat thinner than other Gegno but still one of the taller ones. Unlike others around the hanger, they're wearing a dark-brown vest of sorts, adorned with various small badges.`
			`	Finally, they gesture you to follow them outside of the hanger, leading you to a smaller area, albeit still only partially constructed like the rest of the station. In it are some other Gegno going to and from another wall-mounted display that also lists various jobs. Thankfully, these share the same visuals as the others, showing more mineable asteroids with tally-marks, though these jobs seem to request more than the others, and pay more as well.`
			`	You turn around to address at the Gegno that led you here once more, but they already have vanished to somewhere else in the station. Although they continue to treat you dismissively, it appears you've now been given access to more demanding and rewarding jobs. Perhaps they are beginning to place some value in you after all.`

It could be that they ran out of fuel, or some internal malfuction, but it is strange that it is far away from Gegno home space.`
			`	Since the Gegno are very cautious of your involvement with their civilization, it might be better to report the stranded vessel to them on Tchyss so to that they can handle it internally. Then again, who knows how long the crew have before the ship's life support systems fail, so you could also try aiding them.`

				`You decide on trying to assist the Gegno ship. After docking with it, you gather the necessary equipment and make your way to a boarding hatch, which opens up before you.

There, you see a few Gegno attempting repairs on a damaged generator, while some others are having a discussion, which is suddenly dropped short once they notice you.
