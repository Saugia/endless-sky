However, today seems to be different as you are approached directly by one of Gegno, who is carrying a tablet device larger than ones you've seen others handle before.`
			`	Standing before you, they hold their device to their chest as they begin tapping and dragging on it with their free hand. Their appearance is more similar to members of the Scin you've interacted with before; somewhat thinner than other Gegno but still one of the taller ones. Unlike others around the hanger, they're wearing a dark-brown vest of sorts, adorned with various small badges.`
			`	Finally, they gesture you to follow them outside of the hanger, leading you to a smaller area, albeit still only partially constructed like the rest of the station. In it are some other Gegno going to and from another wall-mounted display that also lists various jobs. Thankfully, these share the same visuals as the others, showing more mineable asteroids with tally-marks, though these jobs seem to request more than the others, and pay more as well.`
			`	You turn around to address at the Gegno that led you here once more, but they already have vanished to somewhere else in the station. Although they continue to treat you dismissively, it appears you've now been given access to more demanding and rewarding jobs. Perhaps they are beginning to place some value in you after all.`

Faint sounds of deeply-pitched buzzers begin emminating from the halls, and most Gegno slowly begin marching down towards the source of the commotion.

Two of the Gegno are around the average civilian build, with one of them in gear similar to those you've seen cargo haulers wear, and the other in a much heavier gear set with various tools attached to it, like those who work on infrastructural maintenance.

They turn the display to you, and on it shows a sort of blueprint of the station interior, with some of the blocks being hatched off. From what you can gather, those are the sections that don't have a working atmosphere, which require you to wear your environmental suit.

Waiting by it is a small group of Gegno, all wearing the same heavy equipment as the lead, who is also present. Some of them are equipped with strange, large tools, and a few others are surrounding a large crate of various other tools. It is eerily silent once the three of you arrive, several of them gazing in your direction.`

Instead, is a gaping hole into space, with tons of debris floating about. Drifting slowly away from the station in the distance is a large Gegno mining ship, with the front section dented and banged up.`

As you wait for them to work the door, a huge Gegno cargo ship slowly pulls up to the bay, and out from it pours a much larger group of Gegno than the ones you're with, all wearing even more advanced-looking gear and much more intricate power suits. They move with a swiftness and precision several levels beyond what you saw before.`
			`	Back inside the station, you're escorted back to where your ship is docked. The maintenance lead then approaches you personally, fully acknowledging you for the first time. They lean down aside you on one knee, and with a fist, pound on the back of your neck, which almost makes you fall forward. You're not sure what that means, though if they actually wanted to knock you to the ground, they very easily would have done so. With one last look, they walk away with the group of Gegno, many of whom are hitting one another or snorting loudly. Though some still remain cold and silent, the sight of enthusiasm from the rest is certainly something you're not used to.`

			`	Since the station is half a hazard in itself, working in a dangeorus environment, especially with the Gegno that you have a difficult time so much as exchanging a word with, doesn't sound appealing. You attempt to convey this to the Gegno, shaking your head and arms to their request. They glare at you once more and snort, before marching off somewhat upset back to the other in the corner, handing back their tablet. They raise their voice at the other Gegno, and after pointing in your direction aggressively, leave the docking bay and you back to your business.`
