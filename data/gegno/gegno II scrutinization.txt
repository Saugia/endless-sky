There are messy bundles of wires attached at random locations around it, and various controls protruding from a dasboard at level with your chest - nothing like the simplified tablets they've used thus far. On the cracked and beaten up display are a series of graphics in a list that seem to be updating in real-time.`

Their appearance is more similar to members of the Scin you've interacted with before - somewhat thinner than other Gegno, but still taller than many. Unlike others in the background, they're wearing a dark-brown vest of sorts, adorned with various small badges, along with a belt decorated with metallic shapes the size of small books.`
			`	Glaring at you for a moment, the Gegno reaches for one of the items on their belt and slots it into the dashboard, and following that, all of the text and images on the screen suddenly light up. They test the device, navigating through the UI with the controls with ease as they make the same loud clangs and clunks of old machinery. Everything dims again when they remove the metal chip, which must be some sort of key.`
			`	They turn to you and stare at you, emitting a low grumbling while in thought. Flipping through some of the keys on their belt, they pick out one and hand it to you. They weigh a lot more than they look, and are a larger in your grip compared to the Gegno's.`

However, there are listings that have graphics resembling minable asteroids with tally marks on the side, which is something you can do on your own. Not a moment later, the Gegno leaves you with your key, already having vanished to somewhere else in the station.`
			`	Mining jobs may not be the best way to learn more about the Gegno, but having job access to begin with is at least one way to start building relations with them.`

You attempt to grap both handles, shifting your weight to lift.

Two of the Gegno are around the average civilian build, with one of them in gear similar to those you've seen cargo haulers wear, and the other in a much heavier gear set with various tools attached to it, like those who work on infrastructural maintenance.

Waiting by it is a small group of Gegno, all wearing the same heavy equipment as the lead, who is also present.

It is eerily silent once the three of you arrive, several of them gazing in your direction.`

Instead, is a gaping hole into space, with tons of debris floating about. Drifting slowly away from the station in the distance is a large Gegno mining ship, with the front section dented and banged up.`

It's not your place to tell them they're being wasteful, though, or rather, you probably couldn't.`

Later on, other squads rotate crates in and out of the airlock after they're filled up with salvage, and one group eventually makes their way to you.

Aside from distant mountainous rock formations, it almost appears as there is a lack of any civilization, but you start to notice long, spindling roads crossing from one horizon to another. The blocky Gegno ship, owned by the hauling lead that personally escorted you here, slowly moves into view from above and moves to escort you ahead.`

Occasionally inbetween the roads are small towers, likely checkpoints of sorts for those traveling the great plains. Up ahead, a small city on the floor of the desert comes into view, likely being your destination. However, as the Gegno leads you closer to it, you realize it's not something as simple as that. The whole structure is actually an enormous land-crawler, currently resting on its six gigantic treads.`
			`	The crawler might as well be a city as it even has its own landing ports, one of which you touch down on. Other Gegno ships of various sizes are parked nearby, loading up on many heavy-looking cargo crates and materials. A group of workers then slowly roll several crates of supplies towards your own ship.`

The Gegno brazenly loading the materials in the ship's cargo, doing so more efficiently than you'd expect those back on the station would. Before you know it, they are gone as quickly as they came, and not a single one remains to even tell you where to take the cargo, leaving an unspoken expectation of you. Maybe this is why the Gegno was having a hard time looking for someone for the job.`
