Another awkward pause ensues, with the other Gegno looking at you, and then back at the lead, who instructs them to quickly escort you back down the corridor you came from.`

			`Making your way to the spaceport, a large freighter rocks into view on your leftside, intentionally lining up with your flight path. Not only that, but they seem to be angling away from the spaceport you normally dock at in such a way that would make you veer off-course. Moving against the flow of traffic doesn't seem characteristic of the Gegno, so the pilot of the ship might be trying to get you to fly with them.`

			`Making your way to the spaceport, a large freighter rocks into view on your leftside, intentionally lining up with your flight path and flying just ahead of you. You recognize this behavior from when you encountered ships of the Scin on another world, where they lead you to a specific location. It could be that the pilot of this ship wants you to follow them to somewhere else on the planet.`

			`	The freighter continues flying past the spaceport and off towards the spanning deserts with you in tow. You occasionally pass one of the extensive, towering highways that seem to stretch across the planet. A large structure comes into view up ahead, some sort of mining rig, except it is large enough to dock ships such as the freighter you're tailing. It is like one massive drill burrowing deep into the planet's mantle, spewing out clouds of smoke as it processes the ore it digs out with internalized refineries.`
			`	You fly up to it, and a few clamps and supports around the main structure latch onto your ship, the same happening with the freight ship. There's a small gathering site where pilots meet up, and it's there you find out that the Gegno from the station, the hauling lead, is the pilot of the freighter. While a team of Gegno quickly unload your ship of the materials, you notice another group rushing to replace the emptying cargo bay with other things - various architectural structures, machines and other industrial equipment. The Gegno didn't communicate anything about this in the mission request, so you go looking for the haul lead. As soon as you find them, they're already marching up to you, and briefly show you a display of <destination>. Before you could get a say in the matter, they rush back over to their own freighter, also preparing to depart once their own crew loads their ship with similar cargo.`

			`	The freighter moves out of your way once you start making a direct approach to the port in the mountainside, continuing to fly off towards the spanning deserts until it disappears over the horizon. Waiting for you on your landing pad is a crew of Gegno, as well several large land-based vehicles that look like they came out of a post-apocalyptic movie. Several times larger than some of the largest Earthen vehicles you know, they have several exhaust pipes jutting outward and giant segment with cargo bays of their own. As usual, the Gegno unload your ship with an efficiency far greater than you're used to. Once full, the vehicles roll away, one by one, towards the massive spanning highways that go off towards the deserts. It's a wonder how well-built the bridges are to support something as large and heavy as those carrying around raw materials.`
			`	It's almost eerie how quiet it becomes now that the Gegno are gone, the only thing breaking the silence being a notification that you have been credited a payment of 150,000 credits.`

			`It takes a moment for an unloading crew to show up, and when they do, you recognize them as the more lively bunch that were working on construction in another part of the station, consisting of Gegno of all sizes. They converse with one another more than the Gegno on Ef Aourtdye do, or at least, more than you've seen. Some of them haul equipment away in carts, and others carry machinery by themselves, some of it looking several times heavier than themselves. The hauling lead is standing by your ship and watching as the others do their work, but they too seem a bit more animated than other times, pacing a little bit. For no reason you could decipher, they throw a fist at it, and you swear they leave a dent in the side. You aren't sure how happy you are about that, but it wouldn't be the first time.
			`	Once their crew has finished unloading, they personally hand you <payment> in credit sticks, pick up the last cargo cart themselves, and follow after the rest of the Gegno.`
