Unlike others around the hangar, they're wearing a dark-brown vest of sorts, adorned with various small badges.`
			`	Finally, they gesture you to follow them, leading you to a smaller area, albeit still only partially constructed like the rest of the station. In it are some other Gegno going to and from another wall-mounted display that also lists various jobs. Thankfully, these share the same visuals as the others, showing more minable asteroids with tally-marks, though these jobs seem to request more than the others, and pay more as well.`

Although the Gegno continue to treat you dismissively, it appears you've now been given access to more demanding and rewarding jobs. Perhaps they are beginning to place some value in you after all.`

Despite the size of the station, the recent decline in activity only continues the trend.

In the middle of the area are three Gegno in various attire standing around one of the station's support beams, leading others down the various corridors with the aid of tablet devices. Two of the Gegno are around the average civilian build, with one of them in gear similar to those you've seen cargo haulers wear, and the other in a much heavier gear set with various tools attached to it, like those who work on infrastructural maintenance.

Looking down to their tablet, they drag their large fingers around a few times, scrolling through various pages of information. Another Gegno comes up behind you in a lighter gear set, and the maintenance lead speaks to them briefly. Another awkward pause ensues, with the other Gegno looking at you, and then back at the lead, who instructs them to quickly escort you back down the corridor you came from.`
			`	As you're escorted back down the halls, a few more Gegno along the way give you passing glares, and on occasion, the one escorting you grunts at them, though you're not sure in what manner.

They turn the display to you, and on it shows a sort of blueprint of the station interior, with some of the blocks being hatched off. From what you can gather, those are the sections that don't have a working atmosphere, which require you to wear your environmental suit.

You're then escorted to the entrance of another docking bay, with red lights glowing all around. Waiting by it is a small group of Gegno, all wearing the same heavy equipment as the lead, who is also present. Some of them are equipped with strange, large tools, and a few others are surrounding a large crate of various other tools. It is eerily silent once the three of you arrive, several of them gazing in your direction.`

With a few clanks and harsh metal sounds, the warning lights and buzzers go out, and the door opens, revealing the docking bay - or at least, where one is supposed to be. Instead, is a gaping hole into space, with tons of debris floating about. Drifting slowly away from the station in the distance is a large Gegno mining ship, with the front section dented and banged up.`

It's not your place to tell them they're being wasteful, though, or rather, you probably couldn't.`

			`	After gesturing an arm towards your right, the Scin give you a puzzled look, with the most forward one craning their head to the right. They turn around and talk with one of the others, and after a brief moment, they all begin leaving the spaceport almost abruptly. After only a few moments they're gone, and the uneasy atmosphere they brought to the facility dissipates, with the other Gegno going about their business.`

			label "mimic"

			`	You do your best to mimic the gesture the Scin did, making some sort of oval shape with your hands. The most forward Scin watches you perform the action with what might be intrigue, looking at you with a calculated expression. They suddenly pull out a small device, writing down a few notes on it using two of their fingers. Looking back to you, they tilt their head to the left, and along with the other Scin, abruptly leave the facility. Strangely, more Scin are leaving than you had first counted to begin with - perhaps some were hidden in the crowd amongst other Gegno. For one reason or another, the Scin seemed pretty interested in their interaction with you.`

			`	You reach out to the image representing the binary stars, and as you do, the Scin that had spoke tilts their head to the left while their upper body bounces a little bit in a paced manner. Almost abruptly, the group of Scin then begin leaving the spaceport without further interaction. As they do, you notice that there are quite a few more leaving that the ones that had addressed you - the others might have been in the background with other Gegno, or maybe you miscounted to begin with. Still, they seemed pretty interested with you for some reason or another.`

			label "red star"
				set "scin: meeting iugil alt"
			`	After reaching out to the red star, all three Scin begin talking with one another for some time. You aren't sure what they're saying, but whatever it is they seem pretty interested in discussing it. A few more moments go by until the Scin that had addressed you cranes their head to the left while looking at you. Right after they turn towards the other Scin again, all of them begin leaving the spaceport abruptly. The uneasy atmosphere the Scin brought to the facility dissipates quickly, and everything returns to normal with the other Gegno going about their business.`

			label "yellow star"
			`	The Scin that had spoken out to you gives you a strange look as you point to the yellow star. As they do, the other two Scin simply look at each other in silence, then back to the third, who now has their palm placed against one of their cheeks. They seem to be pondering something, but it's not long before they signal the others to leave the spaceport. They leave quickly, although strangely, there are more than three Scin leaving by the time they make it to the other side of the facility. You aren't sure where the others came from - maybe they were hidden in the crowd amongst the other Gegno.`
			`	Although they left abruptly, the Scin at least showed some interested in you. Whatever the reason is, though, you're not sure.`

			`	(Stay calm and wait.)`

			`	You stay still and wait to see what happens next. For a moment everything appears to be calm, until they fire once more at the floor, this time closer to where they stand. Before they can fire another shot, a loud bellowing comes from the side of the room, and a group of Gegno who are not Scin march up angrily, shouting and grunting in their own language.`
			`	In what might be ignorance, the Scin continues to fire at the floor between you and them. The shots seem random at first, but with each new scar on the surface you realize they're drawing some sort of pattern, until they make what looks like a planet. Once more, they fire in your direction, barely hitting the spot in front of your feet, and seemingly wait for some sort of response.`

			label "drawing"
			`	In an attempt to mimic the Scin, you fire your pistol at the drawing on the ground. In response, the Scin appears excited, or intrigued in some manner. Almost as suddenly as they showed up, they begin to leave the spaceport, but not before arguing with the other Gegno that have approached. Aside from them, the rest of those in the spaceport are much less taken aback by everything, still almost unbothered.`
			`	You notice that there are more than a few Scin leaving the spaceport, or at least, more than you had first met. Others must have been hidden amongst the crowd. Whatever that may mean, it's clear that the Scin were interested in you for some reason.`
				decline

			label "attack"
			`	You pull out your pistol as fast as you can and fire back at them before anything else could happen, hitting them directly in the chest. They stumble backward on the ground, and the entire spaceport once again goes silent.`
			`	Several other Scin wielding blade weapons jump out from out the crowd and surround you, though they hold their ground while the others are in thought. Other Gegno in the spaceport step a bit back, looking onward in uncertainty. Those arguing with the Scin become even more upset, one of them gesturing to you and shouting in your direction as well.`
			`	After some sort of debate, the Scin lift their their fallen member and eventually leave the spaceport with them. Surprisingly, the rest of the Gegno go back to their business, with the most you get being occasional glares, despite the life or death situation.`
