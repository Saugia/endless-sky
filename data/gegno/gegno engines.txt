	description "The RG18 is a moderately large thruster used by the Gegno Vi. Ion Torch Thrusters are similar to human ion thrusters, but their explosive exhaust causes them to run hotter. However, they also require slightly less energy."

	description "In order to power the small Halite frame, the Gegno Scin developed this smaller engine system.

	description "Rather than developing on the Ion Torch design of the Gegno Vi, the Gegno Scin began work on a plasma-based thruster. They are more compact, weigh less, and produce significantly more thrust. However, since Ion Torches expel some of their heat in their thrust, the more stable and powerful SC thrusters tend to run hotter."

	description "The Gegno Scin have taken another step forward from the SC-14 class Engine System, incorporating both reverse and forward thrust into a single engine. In order to field the SC-15, the Scin had to design their largest ships around the thrusters, rather than fit it on later. The ability to reverse is especially important in engagements with the Gegno Vi's forward-heavy combat vessels."
