		description `There is evidence that the nearby Gegno Scin have attempted to establish a presence on this barren moon in the form of several partially-constructed buildings and landing zones scattered about the surface. In recent times, however, the opposing Gegno Vi have fielded their own forces to take control of the system, and have begun a number of operations to convert existing infrastructure and set up posts of their own, claiming the moon in their name.`
		spaceport `The Vi have made makeshift landing zones and outposts, such as this one, for the group of warriors they've distributed across the moon. Although their numbers are no more than that of a small village, those who are present have accomplished a considerable amount during their time on the surface while the fleets above defend them.`

	planet "Ghneoe"
		description `Ghneoe's orbital period is dominated by a very long dry season due to the binary stars at the system's center. However, during a short portion of the year, Ghneoe experiences an intense water cycle that results in a boom of greenery and wildlife activity, developing a short-lived but flourishing ecosystem. Much of the flora and fauna have adapted to such drastic shifts in climate, and return to a dormant state once the intense heat cycle returns.`
		description `	Unlike its moon, Ghneoe sees few to no colonization efforts from either the Gegno Vi or Scin, perhaps due to the abnormal weather cycles, continued system warfare, or a combination of both.`

		description `This massive station is the only orbital structure that can be found in Gegno space, and is still under heavy construction. A majority of the exterior seems complete, the interior is noticeably lacking in comparison. Recently, an accidental crash-landing has resulted in heavy damage to one of the hangar sections, leading to the arrival of several large teams of Gegno, hard at work on repairs. A large portion of the station is filled with crew quarters and living sections, all more expansive than those in human space, and the outside is enveloped in many docking bays of various sizes. Along with the influx of Gegno workers, there is an increase in ship traffic due to the incident.`
		spaceport `Gegno of all kinds are walking to and fro, some seeming either very tired and overworked, while recent arrivals are working with an efficiency and speed much greater than the rest. Many of them pass through the docking bay section you're presently given permission to access, while the rest traverse a larger portion of the station that is restricted only to Gegno.`
