The Shale is the Gegno's equivalent of a shuttle: a small and compact transport.

The resulting platform, the Gypsum, is not much more than a flying drill with cargo containers, engines, and a bridge attached behind it, making it cost-efficient and easy to manufacture.`
	description `	Because of the Gegno's limited technology, the Gypsum is much more sluggish than similarly sized ships elsewhere in the galaxy, making it too slow to chase faster asteroids. For those asteroids it can catch up to, the powerful excavator drill is able to grind materials out with ease.`

	description `The Augen-class is an ancient battleship proposed by the Vi as a large weapons platform for their Ballistic Cannons. It was built in secret over many years in Enbi's canyon shipyard, and for many periods of time its construction was put on hold. The recent civil war with the Gegno Scin gave reason to complete the warship, although it is still somewhat of a relic compared to current vessels in the service of the Vi fleet.`
	description `	This project was meant to result in two sister-ship behemoths, but the blueprints for the other design went missing early in the process, and are currently nowhere to be found.`

	description `While the style of longer battleship-esq vessels is a Gegno Vi staple, another shipyard rose to the competition for Vi war vessels. The Eclogite is one of the newest designs in the Gegno Vi fleet - a gunboat armed to the teeth with cannons, and maneuverability that the Gegno Vi's larger ships lack. It plays the role of a hit-and-run vessel, unloading volleys of shells against a target's armor in a rapid maneuver before adjusting its position for another pounding.`

	description "Continuing on with the design concept of the Vi's Eclogite, the Diorite is made by a separate shipyard from other larger Vi vessels. Rather than being a platform for large turreted mounts, the Diorite is focused on having powerful forward weaponry in the form of two mounted Ballistic Cannons and a pair of Irate Cannon Turrets to support them. In conjunction with this configuration, the Diorite is much more maneuverable than other Vi ships in its class and can easily keep a beat on other ships its size, sometimes smaller ones."

	description `Hornfels are the workhorse of the Gegno Vi's military - decently sized, decently fast, and more than decently armed warships for the frontline of operations. Hornfels are also the most configurable ship in the Vi's fleet, lined with many cargo racks to support cargo pods, allowing them to provide a secondary cargo transport role for when the Vi require replacement supplies in war. Other variants of Hornfels are occasionally found with adjustments to carry a larger payload rather than cargo load. This usage as a multi-role ship is extremely valued and is the reason why the Hornfel is one of the Vi's most popular ships.`

	description `The Mica is the Gegno Scin's take on a shuttlecraft, and is based on the Shale and the Vi's Slate. It is ever so slightly smaller, since the Scin aren't as large, but carries newer engine systems so it is almost twice as fast as the Shale and the Slate.`

	description `Coesites are smaller warships that the Scin use as screening vessels during battle with the Vi. They are speedy and carry two turret mounts which allow them to always be orbiting and firing on the move. Being a smaller design, these ships are relatively easy to manufacture, and are often fielded in groups so they may overtake vessels much larger than them.`

	description `Built upon a similar frame to the Coesite, the Tridymite serves as a small luxury transport vessel for the Gegno Scin. Tridymites are typically used as research vessels, transporting crews of scientists from one location to another, or as private vessels for top ranking Scin scientists. Additionally, Tridymites can occasionally be found used by the military as scout craft.`

	description `Felsics are based on Schists, but offer many upgrades in exchange for less durability and space for engines. The Scin have opted for three turret mounts, as well as expanded capacity for outfits and weapons. All this allows these ships to perform logistical duties well as well as doubling as a secondary combat vessel, making up for the lack of a dedicated Scin warship.`

	description `The mighty Feldspar is a Scin creation to behold. As a testbed for the new Halite Fighters, Feldspars bring their own small fleets with them and overwhelm their enemy. They also were designed as a semi-experimental platform, built around a brand new multi-engine system and the latest in Gegno plasma technology.`
	description `	Able to keep a decent stance away from a battle while putting down artillery fire, Feldspars are quite a dangerously well-rounded ship for their size. On the downside, they are more susceptible to hull damage like any other Scin warship, especially when alone. As such, they rely on their fighters since they aren't a dedicated warship themselves.`

	description `Muscovites are large independent research platforms with decently-sized cargo holds, allowing them to perform as a reliable heavy freighter for the Gegno Scin. A large number of bunks eitehr help transport groups of Scin scientists to their project destinations, where they perform research or experiments, or allow for mobile on-board demonstrations and observations. Each Muscovite is equipped with a rear fighter docking bay capable of carrying two Halites, typically used to ship Halite fighters around Scin space to resupply carriers. Along with their three dorsal turrets, Muscovites can also be used as a secondary warship when needed.`
	description `	Like other Gegno Scin ships, Muscovites themselves are an experimental test bed, and are built around the large engine system tested on Feldspars, making them notably fast for their size.`
