	description "Irate Cannons are a rudimentary cannon technology that fire explosive projectiles made out of condensed energy and metal, making them effective against armor. They fire decently fast, but one cannon alone is barely enough to output any sort of meaningful damage, which is why they are often found clustered together in numbers."

	description "A caliber higher than the Irate Cannon, Chloeric cannons fire larger, slower rounds that do a noticeable chunk of damage to a ship's hull. However, due to the nature of the cannon, it is, along with other Gegno weaponry, very ineffective against any sort of shielding."

	description "	A flaw in the shell design, however, is that point defense systems are just able to make them out as valid targets on account of their slower speed, material make-up, and size nearing a small missile."

	description "Mounted on a turret, a Chloeric Cannon is much more devastating without the need to keep a target in front to land shots. It can consistently put out damage to a target's hull, and with multiple turrets, any shieldless vessel is forced to retreat after a decent enough bombardment."
	description "	As with the regular mount, the shells are large and slow enough to be targeted by point defense systems."

	description "The Gegno Ballistic Cannon tops its sister cannons as the highest caliber. A huge, self-sustaining turret mount with its own vent ports is necessary for one of these cannons to even be fitted on a ship, provided there are crew to operate it."
	description "	The shells a Ballistic Cannon fires almost equate to that of explosive rockets, dealing tremendous hull damage. However, due to their lethargic nature and material composition, they are just as easily vulnerable to point defense systems."

	description "The Gegno Scin are the first Gegno to advance plasma technology to the point where it can be used in combat. Asuit Batteries work very similar to human Energy Blasters, firing small condensed plasma projectiles at high rates of fire. With 4 blasters on a turreted mount, it produces a constant stream of damage upon a target."
	description "	Although each shot does not hit very hard, consistent fire adds up - but so does energy usage."

	description "Unlike humans, the Gegno Scin were able to research beam technology much earlier in their timeline, although at a much slower efficiency. Several experiments eventually led up to the Talc Laser, a very basic beam laser that is strong against hull armor. A consistent source of Talc Laser damage is extremely effective against the slow moving ships of the Gegno Vi. As an early product there are still a few drawbacks, most notably in how much heat the beam generates while firing."

	description "With a better grasp on plasma and energy weaponry, the Gegno Scin developed a larger blaster weapon to mount on the Feldspar Carrier as a counter to the Gegno Vi's huge cannon weaponry. The Acuit Artillery Cannon outranges most weapons in Gegno space, and has a rate of fire higher than most other weapons, making it a very efficient bombardment weapon from afar."
