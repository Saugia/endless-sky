	description "Though still far from a weakness compared to the technology of most other species, the hull repair systems employed by the Quarg are not as powerful as one might expect. Evidently they prefer to rely on their exceptionally powerful shield generators, and it isn't hard to see why this tactic has yet to fail them."
