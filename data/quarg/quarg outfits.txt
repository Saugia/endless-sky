	description "Although humanity is now capable of producing antimatter in relatively significant quantities when compared to a thousand years ago, it is still nothing compared to the Quarg. The Quarg can produce enough antimatter to outfit every ship with an extremely efficient Antimatter Core, producing extreme amounts of energy with surprisingly little waste heat."

	description "The most coveted of Mata weapons. Through unfathomable means, this weapon tangles the fabric of spacetime in such extreme ways that it forms closed time-like curves, along with chaotic gravitational forces and fascinating relativistic effects that slows the target down. Solid matter bends and crumbles under the chaos, and shield matrices are forced to interact with themselves, with catastrophic results. As if fulfilling their own intended destiny, the projectiles are slightly drawn to their target as well. Relic advises that attempting to tinker with this weapon to create a time machine voids warranty, and often results in certain death."

	description "The technology behind this weapon is incomprehensibly complex, even for ancient Mata standards. With a pulse of negative energy, it creates a linear rift in spacetime, generating extreme negative gravitational forces in its path that splits matter apart as if it wasn't there, going right through. While it is capable of piercing shields just as well, inside them, the interference from the matrix disrupts the beam and lowers the damage, so Relic recommends pairing it with their own Chronovortex weapons to weaken shields first."
